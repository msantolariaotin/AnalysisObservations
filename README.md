# AnalysisObservations

Repository to open and apply some basic statistics to different datasets.

Good practice: use the scripts of AnalysisObservations in your local/machine with the same environment from the .yml file in directory /libobs/. The name of the env is at the top of the .yml that you can open as .txt.
